# mBoxd

Jumpstart different and easy with mBoxd, an all-in-one or cherry-picked solution for projects of any size.

The principle behind mBoxd In is very simple in it packs the best conventions of the web.
- DRYer than Grunt, Gulp or npm scripts.
- Yaml/Mongo based data
- Stylus, Coffee and Pug for best CSS, JS and HTML
- A new scope-based system for maximized efficiency in style rendering

**This is a work in progress and is currently not to be used as is.**

## Terse, potent, handy, pretty.

Communication evolves rapidly and some language and conventions stand out of the crowd.

Other options and conventions do exist. Bootstrap. Semantic. Harp. Grunt. Gulp.
But so has been other bulky languages and conventions that clutter and have each their own shortcomings which mBoxd intends to surpass.

* *Terse*: Read and write code easily
* *Potent*: Powerful
* *Handy*: 
* *Pretty*: Beauty's in the eye of the viewer, but 

## Languages and conventions used

**Yaml**
* *L*: Multilingual content. The object rendered by L defaults to the one in data.yml when a value is not undefined

**Stylus**
* *mBoxd*: Namespaced css. This is the actual birthplace of the project. Coupled with 

**Coffeescript**
**Pug**
* *Partial*: 

**Markdown**
